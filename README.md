Some python scripts I programmed to manage drafted cards and open packs
The program look for drafted cards in .ydk files in a ProjectIgnis folder installed
It can also add drafted cards from the Pack-Opener

!WARNING! THIS SCRIPTS ARE NOT OPTIMIZED AND WELL POLISHED. UPDATER NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED TO FULLY WORK.
